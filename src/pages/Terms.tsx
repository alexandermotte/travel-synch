              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We charge a subscription fee to use our Services (which includes VAT) plus the cost of any booking (for which VAT is not payable) you file through our website (except where it is a replacement covered by under paragraph 4.1.3). We take all reasonable care to ensure that the price of the service advised to you is correct. However, please see paragraph 11.3 for what happens if we discover an error in the price of the travel arrangement you order. Cost of Services.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                As the price of the Service is payable upfront, there will be no additional VAT to pay even if the rate of VAT changes afterwards. However, if the rules change meaning VAT must be paid on the government fee, we will inform at the point you make the application and charge you this amount.

                It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product's correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product's correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens, and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any right to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these terms.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">14.4 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">14.5 Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later</h3>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
                If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the services, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.
