              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>15.1 We may transfer this agreement to someone else.</strong> We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens, and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.</li>
                <li><strong>15.2 You may not transfer your rights to someone else.</strong> You may not transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person.</li>
                <li><strong>15.3 Nobody else has any rights under this contract.</strong> This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any right to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these terms.</li>
                <li><strong>15.4 If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force.</strong> Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</li>
                <li><strong>15.5 Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.</strong> If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide the services, we can still require you to make the payment at a later date.</li>
                <li><strong>15.6 Intellectual property rights.</strong> All intellectual property rights in, arising out of or in connection with the Site and our Services shall be owned by us. You acknowledge that in respect of any third party intellectual property rights in the Services, your use of intellectual property rights is conditional on us obtaining a written licence from the relevant licensor on such terms as will entitle us to license such rights to you.</li>
                <li><strong>15.7 Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings.</strong> These terms are governed by Dutch law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the products in the Dutch courts.</li>
                <li><strong>15.8 Our fast-track e-commerce services are provided on a best-effort basis.</strong> We will work diligently to process your order and issue the requested service as quickly as possible. However, we cannot be held liable for any delays or failure to meet a customer's expected delivery time. Circumstances beyond our control may impact the timeliness of our services. Kindly note that requests submitted after the optimal time frame may encounter additional processing delays, due to practiced submission times provided by the airports.</li>
